I wonder what is going to happen.
I don't know what exactly this exercise is suppose to teach me.
I opened a repository on GitHub and copied it to my computer.
I created a file (this one) in that repository locally (on my computer).
I entered commands that I think was meant to save the data I inputed.
However, I don't know why there are so many steps.
It's kind of confusing.
